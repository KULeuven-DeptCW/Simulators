Simulators
==========

Simulators for "Automata and Computability" and "Fundamentals of Computer Science"

Contents
--------

Under development:

 - Primitive recursive functions

To do:

 - Finite state machines
 - Pushdown automata
 - Turing machines
 - Lambda expressions

Contributing
------------

Students are welcome to contribute to the repository themselves.


Programming
-----------

Programming is done in *JavaScript* (as HTML pages) so that most systems are able to simulate the different automata. Furthermore `d3.js` and `bootstrap.css` allow fast visualizing.
